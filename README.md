# DESCRIPTION:
The Movie App is a web application built with React that enables users to search for movies, view detailed information, and manage their favorite movies. It leverages the OMDB API to fetch comprehensive movie data, including titles, release years, posters, and brief descriptions. The application is designed with a modern, responsive user interface, making it easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tools and Technologies Used:

1. React.js: Core library for building the interactive user interface, including dynamic state management with useState and useEffect for seamless updates to movie data.
2. Axios: A reliable HTTP client library used to make API requests to the OMDB API for fetching movie details.
3. OMDB API: Source for detailed movie data, including title, year, poster, and additional information.
4. Bootstrap: CSS framework used to create a clean, responsive, and visually appealing design.
5. React Router: Facilitates navigation between different sections of the app, such as Home, Search, and Favorites.
## How It Works:

1. Home Section: Displays a collection of popular movies fetched from the OMDB API when the app loads.
2. Search Feature: Users can enter a movie name in the search bar and fetch relevant results by clicking the "Search" button.
3. Favorites Section: Allows users to add movies to their list of favorites and remove them as needed, ensuring easy access to their preferred films.
4. Data Display: Movie data is displayed in neatly styled cards, showing:
Movie title
Release year
Movie poster
5. Error Handling: If a movie is not found or an invalid search query is entered, the app provides a user-friendly error message.
## Key Features:

1. Responsive design ensures usability on various devices.
2. Intuitive navigation between sections (Home, Search, Favorites).
3. Dynamic updates of the movie list and favorites with smooth interaction.
This application is ideal for movie enthusiasts looking for an easy and enjoyable way to browse and manage their favorite films.
